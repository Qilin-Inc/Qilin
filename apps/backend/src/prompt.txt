I want to build dashboard for a "looking for gamers" application. There will be 3 types of users,
1. Super Admin
2. premium user
3. regular user

super admin can view, update, delete, all users
Super admin is able to update demographics details of all users

Most of the demographic details of regualr and premium users will be same except there will be
an extra field as "premium_user: true" for premium user. 

premium and regualr users can update their demographic details except the premium field,

Create necessary endpoint function to facilitate the funtionalties.
